# Fortune teller 2.0

Do the Fortune Teller again but this time with a object.

Write a function named tellFortune that:

prompts the user for 4 arguments: number of children, partner's name, geographic location, job title.

displays to the user his fortune like so: "You will be a X in Y, and married to Z with N kids."

Call that function 3 times with 3 different values for the arguments.

# What number is bigger 2.0

Write a function named greaterNum that:

Takes 2 arguments, both numbers.

Returns whichever number is the greater (higher) number.

Call that function 2 times with different number pairs

Log the output, e.g. "The greater number of 5 and 10 is 5." like we did yesterday.
